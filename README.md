# Roadless-Group3
This was a group project done in STAT 495 at Amherst College where we created a ShinyApp to sample coordinates near roads in the US. This project was based off of this project. 
https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/stew/PercentWithinMileofRoad.pdf

The ShinyApp has a sidebar where you can sample data, add it to a temporary database, and download the data as a .csv file. The mainpanel includes a text display, a map, and the running tallies of points sampled, points in the US, and points near a road.

The ShinyApp can also be accessed at https://r.amherst.edu/apps/kchen22/roadless-group3/ (As of Oct 17, 2021).
